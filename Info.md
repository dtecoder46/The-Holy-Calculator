# Summary

This is a program that is made using a tech stack that I call the "Jesus the Savior" stack (JS front end webpage, JS backend web server, and a JS “database”) and basically acts like a four-function calculator. 

It first starts in the console and allows the user to enter in three basic equations involving either addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents (use **), or the modulus operator (divides two numbers and returns the remainder, use %).

Afterwards, a webpage loads that shows the most recent equation answer.


# Create your own Node.JS web server

If you want to create your own Node.JS web server, please refer to the "Hello Node.js" section of [the Express/Node Introduction article on the mdn web docs site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction).


# Final Notes

You may notice on the mdn web docs article that the hostname constant is set to 127.0.0.1, but using this as the hostname constant will not connect to a Node web server on Replit. Instead, you need to use 0.0.0.0 as the hostname constant.
